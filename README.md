# calculator
This is a simple Calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the structure of the calculator, including a display screen and buttons for numbers, operators, clear, delete, and equals. The CSS file (calculator.css) is used to design the calculator layout, style the buttons, and make the interface clean and user-friendly. The JavaScript file (calculator.js) adds functionality by handling number inputs, performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, clearing the display, deleting the last entered value, and calculating the final result. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and mathematical operations in a simple and practical way.
